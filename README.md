<H1> Word Unscrambler! - The Anagram Solver</h1>
Search for anagrams using a Trie or HashMap, and compare their speeds.

<h2> Usage Instructions </h2>

To start, enter any sequence of up to 25 characters (no symbols or non-english letters).

Once a string of characters has been typed in, you can **click** on either search button, or switch between buttons with the **Up** and **Down** arrow keys and press **enter** to search ("Search with Trie" is selected by default).

After performing a search using either data structure, a list of anagrams for your string of characters will appear. At the bottom of the window, press enter or **click** on the **Reset** button to go back to the main menu and enter a new string.
